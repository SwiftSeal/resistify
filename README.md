Resistify is a program which classifies plant NLRs by their protein domain and motif architecture.
It is designed to be lightweight - no manual database installations or tricky dependencies here!

## Installation

Resistify is available on [Conda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/resistify):

`conda install -c bioconda resistify`

Docker/Podman containers are also available through the [biocontainers repository](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/resistify?tab=tags).
To use these with - for example - singularity, simply run:

`singularity exec docker://quay.io/biocontainers/resistify:0.2.2--pyhdfd78af_0`

Alternatively, Resistify is also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/resistify/):

`pip install resistify`

Please note that Resistify requires [hmmer](http://hmmer.org) as a dependency which will need to be installed if using pip.

## Usage

To get started with Resistify:

```
resistify <input.fa> <output_directory>
```

### Results

Your `input.fa` should contain your protein sequences of interest.
An `output_directory` will be created which will contain the results of your run:
 - `results.tsv` - A table containing the primary results of `Resistify`.
 - `motifs.tsv` - A table of all the NLR motifs identified for each sequence.
 - `domains.tsv` - A table of all the domains identified for each sequence.
 - `nbarc.fasta` - A fasta file of all the NB-ARC domains identified.
 - `nlrs.fasta` - A fasta file of all NLRs identified.

As an example, let's look at the results of a `Resistify` run against the NLR [ZAR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/15230357)

#### results.tsv

|Sequence | Length | Motifs | Domains | Classification | NBARC_motifs | MADA | MADAL | CJID |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|NP_190664.1 | 852 | CNNNNNNNNNLLLLLLLLLL | CNL | CNL | 9 | False | True | False |

The main column of interest is "Classification", where we can see that it has been identified as a canonical CNL.
The "Motifs" column indicates the series of NLR-associated motifs identified across the sequence - this can be useful if an NLR has an undetermined or unexpected classification.
The columns "MADA", "MADAL", and "CJID" correspond to common NLR sequence signatures.
Here, it appears that ZAR1 has a MADA-like motif.

#### motifs.tsv

|Sequence | Motif | Position | Probability | Downstream_sequence | Motif_sequence | Upstream_sequence |

Here, the positions, probabilities, and sequence of NLRexpress motif hits are listed.
The five amino acids upstream and downstream of the motif site are also provided.

#### domains.tsv

Sequence | Domain | Start | End | E_value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
NP_190664.1 | MADA | 0 | 21 | 5e-07 |
NP_190664.1 | CC | 4 | 128 | 7.8e-24 |
NP_190664.1 | NB-ARC | 162 | 410 | 4.6e-90 |
NP_190664.1 | LRR | 511 | 817 | NA |

This file contains the coordinates of NLR domains identified by `Resistify`.
Not that the LRR domain does not have an E-value - this is because it is determined via LRR motifs rather than HMM hits.
I'd treat this file with a bit of caution - in some cases the CC domain will correspond solely to the position of the CC motif rather than the coordinates of a Pfam hit.

### Ultra mode

By default `Resistify` will perform an initial filter to remove non-NLRs prior to motif identification.
Highly degraded or non-canonical NLRs may not be reported.
If you wish to retain these, simply use `--ultra` mode to skip this step.

### Output visualisation

I've kept the output files of `Resistify` fairly minimal so that users can carry out their own analysis/visualisation.
Here are some examples of how `Resistify` can be used to create basic plots.

#### Phylogenetics

`Resistify` extracts the NB-ARC domains of each hit so we can easily build a phylogenetic tree.
Here, we create a tree rooted on the NB-ARC domain of [CED-4](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P30429/entry).
The `mafft | fastree` method is used here for brevity rather than accuracy.

```{bash}
echo -e ">ced4\nREYHVDRVIKKLDEMCDLDSFFLFLHGRAGSGKSVIASQALSKSDQLIGINYDSIVWLKDSGTAPKSTFDLFTDILLMLARVVSDTDDSHSITDFINRVLSRSEDDLLNFPSVEHVTSVVLKRMICNALIDRPNTLFVFDDVVQEETIRWAQELRLRCLVTTRDVEISNAASQTCEFIEVTSLEIDECYDFLEAYGMPMPVGEKEEDVLNKTIELSSGNPATLMMFFKSCEPKTFEKMAQLNNKLESRGLVGVECITPYSYKSLAMALQRCVEVLSDEDRSALAFAVVMPPGVDIPVKLWSCVIPVD" >> output/nbarc.fasta

mafft output/nbarc.fasta | fasttree > output/nbarc.tree
```

We can now plot the tree:

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtree)

tree <- read.tree("output/nbarc.tree")
tree <- treeio::root(tree, outgroup = "ced4")

results <- read_tsv("output/results.tsv") |>
  mutate(Sequence = paste0(Sequence, "_1"))

myplot <- ggtree(tree, layout = "circular") %<+% results

myplot <- myplot +
  geom_tippoint(aes(colour = Classification))
```

#### Domain plotting

Somtimes, it might be of interest to plot the distribution of domains and motifs across each NLR.
Achieving this with `Resistify` is quite simple:

```{R}
library(tidyverse)

motif_translation = c(
  "extEDVID" = "CC",
  "bA" = "TIR",
  "aA" = "TIR",
  "bC" = "TIR",
  "aC" = "TIR",
  "bDaD1" = "TIR",
  "aD3" = "TIR",
  "VG" = "NB-ARC",
  "P-loop" = "NB-ARC",
  "RNSB-A" = "NB-ARC",
  "Walker-B" = "NB-ARC",
  "RNSB-B" = "NB-ARC",
  "RNSB-C" = "NB-ARC",
  "RNSB-D" = "NB-ARC",
  "GLPL" = "NB-ARC",
  "MHD" = "NB-ARC",
  "LxxLxL" = "LRR"
)

domains <- read_tsv("output/domains.tsv")
results <- read_tsv("output/results.tsv")
motifs <- read_tsv("output/motifs.tsv") |>
  mutate(Domain = motif_translation[Motif])

myplot <- ggplot() +
  geom_segment(data = results, aes(y = Sequence, yend = Sequence, x = 0, xend = Length)) +
  geom_segment(data = domains, aes(y = Sequence, yend = Sequence, x = Start, xend = End, colour = Domain)) +
  geom_point(data = motifs, aes(y = Sequence, x = Position, colour = Domain))
```

*Cute! NB: Some false-positive motif hits are evident in this example - it might be of interest to not plot them, or plot only LRR motifs which tend to be a bit more informative.*

## How does it work?

`Resistify` uses a two step process.
First, all sequences are searched for CC, RPW8, TIR, and NB-ARC domains.
This is used to quickly filter out any non-NLR sequences and identify the primary architecture of each NLR.

Secondly, each potential NLR sequence is scanned for CC, TIR, NB-ARC, and LRR associated motifs via NLRexpress. 
These are used as an additional layer of evidence to reclassify each NLR by predicting LRR domains, and predicting any CC or TIR domains which may have been missed in the initial `hmmsearch`.

`Resistify` will also search for N-terminal MADA motifs and CJID domains that are common to CNLs and TNLs respectively.

## A note on run time

Version 0.1.1 has introduced multithreading ðŸŽ‰ - use the `--threads` argument to get started.

The run time of `resistify` scales linearly with the total number of NLRs present in the input sequence file.
A file with 200 NLRs will take approximately twice as long as a file with 100 NLRs.
This does not apply to the total number of *sequences* - an input of 50,000 sequences with 100 NLRs will run just as fast as an input of 1,000 sequences with 100 NLRs.
